The opulent Meiji Shinto Shrine is known for its towering gate and surrounding woods. The city's many museums offer exhibits ranging from classical art (in the Tokyo National Museum) to a reconstructed kabuki theater (in the Edo-Tokyo Museum).",

        description: "Located on a 1.7-mile out-and-back trail near Yigo, Guam, with an elevation gain of about 531 ft, Pagat Cliffs and Cave offer incredible vistas of the eastern coastline of the island and the Pacific Ocean. The cave is pitch dark but full of cold, clear freshwater, which made swimming halfway through the humid hike a wonderful break. Headlights are 100% necessary to see the natural rock formations in the cave! You can take the cliff route back to the trailhead, which passes through ancient village ruins and ceremonial sites.",
